[My process]
step 1: divide the project into two phases
phase 1: build the input page.
phase 2: built the success page.

Phase 1
step 1: research on various techniques to display input on the same page, decide to use Json object which is was recommend as one of the best 
step 2: design the background using the provided style and picture using css absolute.
step 3: split the page into two section(left and right) using flex-box.
step 4: position the cards on the the page to accept the json objects on the leftside of the page.
step 5: design the forms, input and button on the rightside of the page.
step 6: the real work, built my code using React.js in vscode.
step 7: sent the inputs as jSON.parse objects to the success page(phase 2).

Phase 2
step 1: decide to just use the same .css file for both pages to reduce the duration of coding.
step 2: accepted the inputs from home (phase 1).
step 3: redesigned the right side of the success page.
